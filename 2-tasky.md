Tasky is a application that helps users manage their tasks with ease. The goal of this project is to build an application that allows users to manage their tasks in an intuitive manner.

## Key Features
### User Authentication
- Users sign up with the following details
    - first name - required
    - last name - required
    - username - required
    - email address - required
    - password - required
- Upon successful sign up, the user should be redirected to the login page where they can login to their account using **email** or **username** together with their password.
- After successfully logging in, the user should be redirected to a page that displays a list of all their incomplete tasks. If there are no pending tasks, display a friendly message such as **"you don't have any tasks"**
- Make sure to use json web tokens.

### Tasks System
- Users can create a task with the following details:
    - **Title** (required): a short descriptive task title provided by the user.
    - **Description** (required): description for the task.
    - **Date created**: Automatically generated by the application when the task is created.
    - **Last Updated**: timestamp that reflects the last time the task was updated.
    - **isDeleted**: A boolean indicating whether the task is deleted.
    - **isCompleted**: A boolean indicating whether the task is completed.
#### New Task Page
- Implement a clean interface for creating a task
- Upon successful task creation, show a message like "Task created successfully".
- _In this app specifically, for good user experience, you don't have to redirect the user upon successful task creation, instead, stay on the same page just in case the user wants to add a bunch of tasks._

#### Tasks Page
- Implement a Tasks page where the user can view a list of all their active tasks.
- Only tasks that are incomplete and not deleted should be displayed on this page. 
- Each task should be presented in a clean, visually consistent card layout. Every card must include:
    - The task title
    - A short description
    - An option to edit/update the task
    - An option to delete the task

#### Update Task
- When a user clicks the Edit or Update button on a task card, they should be redirected to a dedicated Update Task page.
- On this page, display a form that is pre-populated with the taskâ€™s existing details. The form should also include two actionable button:
    - Update task: saves any changes made to the task's title or description.
    - A button for marking the task as complete or incomplete:
      - If the task is currently **incomplete**, the button should say "Mark as complete" and does just that.
      - If the task is already complete, the button should instead display: "Mark as incomplete" and does just that.
- After either action, the user should be redirected back to the Tasks page.
- If the task was marked as complete, it **should no longer appear** in the task list (since this page only shows incomplete and active tasks).
- If a task is later marked as incomplete again, it should reappear on the tasks page.
- This ensures users can flexibly manage task status while keeping the main task view focused and relevant.

#### Completed Tasks Page
- Create a Completed Tasks page where users can view all of their tasks that have been marked as complete and are not deleted.
- Each task should be displayed in a consistent card layout, similar to the one used on the main tasks page. Every card must include:
    - The task title
    - A brief description
    - An option to edit/update the task (redirects to the update task page)
    - An option to delete the task.

#### Trash Page
- The Trash page is where users can view all tasks that have been deleted.
- This allows users to recover tasks they may have deleted by mistake or clean up tasks they no longer need.
- Only tasks marked as deleted (i.e., isDeleted = true) should appear here. Each deleted task should be displayed in a card layout that includes:
    - The task title
    - A brief description
    - A 'restore' button, when users clicks on this button, it "unmarks" the task as deleted (returns it to it's original state).
- On this page, display a message like "items in trash will be deleted after 30 days". _(you don't have to implement this specific functionality for deleting items in trash after 30 days)_

### Users Profile
- This page includes the following:
    - form pre-filled with their personal details (first name, last name, username, email), users can use this form to update their details - implement functionality for users to update their primary information (first name, last name, username, email).
    - Users should have the ability to upload a profile picture. This feature must be implemented. Once a user updates their profile picture, it should be immediately displayed in the top-right corner of the interface. If the user has not uploaded a profile picture, display their initials instead as a fallback avatar.
    - A form to update the password:
        - The form should contain input fields for current, new password and confirm new password.
        - If a user wants to update their password, they must enter both the current and the new password, if they enter wrong current password, show them an error and don't update the password.
        - Always hash passwords, even the updated password should be hashed.
    - A working logout button.

### More Features
- [Required feature] Logged out users only see the login and sign up buttons in the header.
- [Required Feature] For logged-in users, the header (or dashboard-style layout) should include the following elements:
  - Tasks link
  - New task link
  - Completed tasks link
  - Trash link
  - Profile link
  - A friendly message in the header like "welcome back john"
  - An avatar, if the user has uploaded a profile picture, show it; otherwise, display their initials as a fallback avatar.
- [Required feature] A simple, small Landing Page that introduces the app and invites users to log in or sign up.
- [Required feature] protected routes/pages, certain pages (such as the new entry, profile, etc.) must only be accessible to authenticated users. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

NOTE: YOU ARE WELCOMED TO ADD YOUR OWN FEATURES BUT THE FEATURES LISTED ABOVE ARE **COMPULSORY** TO IMPLEMENT.

- `PATCH /api/user`: update a specific, logged in user's primary information.

## Models
This application will only have the following two models:
- User
  - id - primary key (use uuid)
  - first name - required
  - last name - required
  - email - unique and required
  - username - unique and required
  - password - required
  - avatar - url for user's avatar, not required and the default is null or, empty string or any falsy value.
  - dateJoined - date
  - last profile update - date
  - isDeleted - boolean with a default of false
- Task
  - id - primary key (use uuid)
  - title - required
  - description - required
  - isDeleted - boolean to indicate the task has been deleted, the default value is false.
  - isCompleted - boolean to indicate the task is complete, the default is false.
  - date created - autogenerated by the application, timestamp for when the task was created.
  - date updated - autogenerated by the application, timestamp for when the task was last updated.

- Remember to implement one-to-many relationship between the two (on user can have multiple tasks but one task can only belong to one user).
