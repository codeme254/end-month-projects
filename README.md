Project requirements for Teach2Give students.

## Teach2Give Students Only:
If you come across anything in a project's description that seems incorrect, unclear, outdated, or could simply be improved, you're encouraged to take initiative and open a Pull Request (PR) with your suggested changes.

You're also welcome (and encouraged!) to come up with your own project descriptions for entirely new project ideas beyond what's been provided. Whether it's a concept you've been itching to build or a creative twist on something familiar, write a clear description, outline the required features, and open a Pull Request (PR) to propose it, this way we can have a list of fullstack projects with clear requirements for practicing full stack web development.
